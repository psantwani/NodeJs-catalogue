# Isomorphic JavaScript
Something that renders content on the server-side at the first load, but provides the experience of the SPA applications after that.

# Angular.js
Search robots without JavaScript support cannot index your Angular website content. One workaround could be to use [prerender.io](https://prerender.io/), an external service that renders your site on an external server with a headless browser and sends the result back in HTML. It makes the site readable to bots but also breaks the AngularJS bindings, hence disallowing user interactivity.

# React.js
Provides client and server side rendering with a one-way flow for data-binding. React + Redux + Express = isomorphic goodness.
